Hi, I'm Jose - Project Manager at [Arcadis](https://www.arcadis.com/), where I lead diverse initiatives in hydraulic engineering, hydrology, water quality assessment, and water supply systems. My expertise lies in numerical computing, leveraging specialized software to develop simulation models, data visualization solutions, and analytical frameworks that address complex water resource challenges.

Before, I was Project Engineer and I specialized in planning and dimensioning water infrastructure systems and conducting simulation analyses of flood events in urban wastewater networks. Responsible for technical design, modeling, and implementation of water management solutions.

My professional approach combines civil engineering fundamentals with advanced computational methods. I am proficient in Python, but I also like programming in Go, and JavaScript. Most of the time I use Python to create efficient technical solutions across the water engineering sector. 

Currently exploring the application of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) as general rainfall-runoff models. My professional development focuses on advancing machine learning applications in hydrological modeling while staying current with emerging technologies in the rapidly evolving field of computational hydrology.
