# Explore Phase - Problem Definition and Stakeholders

The first step to take in any project that you want to work on is to connect with the stakeholders. When working with Stakeholders, an important step is to gave them realistic expectations about the limits that AI might be able to help in their particular case. Try to spend some time talking to the people who will be using the technology that you would be building, to better understand the challenges that they face in their job or day to day.

Once you’ve connected with stakeholders, it’s important to pull together the stakeholder’s needs and goals for your project into a clear and concise problem statement. Your problem statement should define the problem you are hoping to address, including reference to key stakeholders and some sense of what sucess would look like, but without necessarily getting into the details of particular technologies that you might deploy. This is an important step because you can get off track very easily in the rest of your project development. If you’re not clear about the problem that you’re hoping to address and who is involved, and you focus too much instead on the technology that you’re trying to build.

It’s important to be very specific and transparent when defining the problem that you are trying to address. A clear problem statement allows you to see what a successful outcome would look like for your project, and will help you and your team stay focused on building a solution that addresses this problem. In special, when you are working on something in a critical use case, like for healthcare, you want to make sure that you are very clear about the problem you’re working on and what are realistic goals that you could achieve while minimizing harm. 

So to recap, a good problem statement shoud:

- Be clear, concise and specific
- Identify key stakeholders
- Give a sense of what success looks like
- And not necessarily reference any particular technology that you aim to deploy
