# Explore Phase - Could AI Add Value?

The final step in this explore phase is to determine whether AI can even add value in addressing the problem that you work on. You would have been thinking about whether the effort, time and expertise you needed to implement an AI solution seems worth it for this particular use case. It maight happen, that after talking to stakeholders, you realize that a simpler solution will be sufficient for the problem, certainly given the amount of resources that you would otherwise put into a more complicated AI system.

Ultimately, however, the question of whether AI can add value or not to any particular solution will depend on the kind of data you have access to and the problem that you will try to address. As a trained dataset for developing an AI model, the data available for a use case can be sometimes a little bit limited in terms of the total amount of volume. But it might be possible to expand the training data with newly categorized examples.

In our consideration of whether AI could add value for a particular project that you’re working on, it’s important to think about the do no harm principle and consider any negative impacts that your work might have. It may not always be obvious, especially at the start, how your work could end up doing harm. But if you’re considering the potential negative outcomes at every phase of your project development and working with your stakeholders on those, the you’ll be more likely to avoid those negative outcomes. Often there will be some very general problems that you will encounter regularly, like privacy and security, other general problems like the trade-off between human and AI decision-making, and there will be also some very specific ones to your particular situation. As an outsider coming in, your are probably not going to know all of these in advance. So this is one of the reasons why we continue to work with stakeholders.

At the end of each phase in the framework, there are plenty of questions you should be asking yourself and your team to ensure that you have what you need to move on to the next phase. At the end of the explore phase, you need to be able to answer these following questions:

- What is the specific problem you are addressing?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- Do you have access to or can you collect the necessary data?
- Could AI add value? Where and how specifically?
- How does the “do no harm” principle come into play?

If you find yoursel exploring a project in the future and the answer to some of the questions remain unclear, it’s best to spend more time in the explore phase. You can spend more time researching the problem and talking to stakeholders until, collectively, you agree that you’re in a position to move forward. In this case, you would be ready to move on to the design phase of the project.
