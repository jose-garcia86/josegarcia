# New workflows and new opportunities

There are many ways that generative AI is leading, not just to cost savings but to revenue growth. But there are so many ways for general-purpose technology, like generative AI, to create value

Changes in workflow with generative AI can be significant, depending on details of your company, but for example by reviewing simple legal document, say a typical non-disclosure agreement or NDA:
- Without generative AI: there may be not much information to gather, and so the layer could just review the document and then give the client feedback.
- With generative AI: Maybe the review of the document could be done much faster, then we use generative AI to create a document to summarize the issues that the layer can send to the client and discuss with them more efficiently. Then the process of giving the client feedback could also become maybe more efficient. 



What I have seen is that, companies that might explore building a system like this, after have built such a system may decide to change the workflow, where after reviewing a document may decide to add an extra fast human verification step, in the middle, just to double check that what the generative AI have said about the document is comprehensive and correct. Before then, having generative AI and the lawyer together try to go to the last step of giving a client feedback. 

This type of re-engineering of workflow is quite common once both generative AI or other AI Tools are inserted into a system. Because when one task is automated or augmented, it often makes sense to rethink what are the other tasks that need to be done together in order to deliver a valuable work product such as a review of a legal document.

There are a few ways in that, generative AI can not just save costs, but lead to significant growth, through new types of service offering or products. In addition to searching for growth opportunities by looking at tasks done by the employees of a company, there is one other framework for analysis that could be useful that frankly isn‘t done as much today, but maybe worth considering for your work. 

Rather than analyzing for employees tasks, consider also analyzing the tasks of your customers. For example, lets say you offer a product or service that help your customers to build websites. I would urge you to consider listing out what are the tasks that your costumers have to do, not just the tasks your employees have to do, but the tasks your costumers have to do.

In this case, maybe your customers have to first select a template for the website to get the initial design, then they have to write a title for the website, then select images, write a copy for the homepage and optimize the copy for SEO to make it easy to find it via search engines. 

If you were to analyze the generative AI potential for your costumers tasks, then you may also identify opportunities, for example writing the title and optimze copy for SEO, as places were generative AI could help your costumers. 

This framework for analysing and brainstorming can sometimes lead companies to build very different product or services to deliver to their costumers.

This can be a recipe for getting a lot of happy costumers and therefore pursuing growth for your business. 

There are many ways in that generative AI is creating value and can lead to growth. In terms of brainstorming frameworks, we found that looking at how you can automate or augment tasks by employees or by your costumers is a useful way to approach thinking how to create that value.
