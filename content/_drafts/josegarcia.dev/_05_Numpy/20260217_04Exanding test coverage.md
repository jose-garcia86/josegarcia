# Expanding Test Coverage

To build reliable apps, its important to expand test cases beyond just adding some test for a  simple input. 

- Test with multiple inputs to verify the multiple options works correctly
- Check edge cases, such attempting to add negative inputs or some similar ones. This ensure invalid input raises an error and prevents incorrect data entry
- Each new test helps handle real-world scenarios and strengthens code reliability.

Address failed tests by updating the code, such as blocking zero or negative inputs. Running all tests should confirm code correctness and robust error handling.
