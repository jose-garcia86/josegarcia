# Tokenizing Sentences and Batching Data

In the world of AI and Machine Learning, data preprocessing is a critical step that often determines the success of a model. Two fundamental tasks in preprocessing are **tokenizing text data** and **batching numerical data**. These tasks help prepare raw data into a format that Machine Learning models can efffectively utilize.

**Tokenization** is a process commonly used in natural language processing NLP.

- Tokenization:
  - Splitting a sentence into individual words or tokens.
  - Essential for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
  - Converts textual data into a structured format that the machine learning algorithms can work with.
  - Improves the performance and accuracy of models by enabling them to understand and analyze text data effectively.

**Batching data** is a technique used to handle large data sets during model training.

- Batching:
  - Divides data into smaller subsets or batches.
  - Enhances computational efficiency by processing batches sequentially instead of the entire dataset at once.
  - Improves model generalization by exposing it to diverse data subsets in each training iteration.
  - Allows for parallel processing, speeding up the training process and reducing memory usage.
