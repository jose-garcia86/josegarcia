# Knowledge Cutoffs in LLM

A knowledge cutoffs is the point in time when a LLM’s training data ends. After this date, the model has no direct knowledge of events, facts or development that occurred.

## Why Knowledge Cutoffs Exist

Language models are trained on massive datasets collected up to a specific date. Once training is complete, the model's knowledge is essentially "frozen" at that point. The model can't automatically update itself with new information - it would need to be retrained with newer data.
