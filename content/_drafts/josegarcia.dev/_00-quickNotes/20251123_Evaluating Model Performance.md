# Evaluating Model Performance

## Precision Calculation

Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives (True positives + False positives)

## Recall Calculation

Recall measures the model’s ability to capture all positive instances. It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives (True positives + False negatives)

Understanding and calculating **precision** and **recall** will give you a better picture of your model’s performance, especially in scenarios where the class distribution is imbalanced.

## Comparing Precision and Recall

You will be provided with the number of True positives, False positives and False negatives for two models. Your Task is to calculate the precision and recall for each model and determine which model has higher precision and which has higher recall.
