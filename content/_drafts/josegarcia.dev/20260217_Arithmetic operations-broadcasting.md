# Arithmetic operations and Broadcasting

We have reached the last lesson in this introduction to NumPy. In this last lesso we will see how NumPy does arithmetic operations on ndarrays. NumPy allows element-wise operations on ndarrays as well as matrix operations. In this lesson we will only be looking at element-wise operations on ndarrays. In order to do element-wise operations, NumPy sometimes uses something called **Broadcasting**. Broadcasting is the term used to describe how NumPy handles element-wise arithmetic operations with ndarrays on different shapes. For example, broadcasting is used implicitly when doing arithmetic operations between scalars and ndarrys.

Let’s start by doing element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, between ndarrays. To do this, NumPy provides a functional approach, where we use functions such as `np.add()`, or by using arithmetic symbols, such as `+`, that resembles more how we write mathematical equations. Both forms will do the same operation, the only difference is that if you use the function approach, the functions usually have options that you can tweak using keywords. It is important to note that when performing element-wise operations, the shapes of the ndarrays being operated on, must hae the same shape or be bradcastable. We0
