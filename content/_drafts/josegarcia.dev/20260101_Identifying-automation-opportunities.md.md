# Identifying Automation Opportunities

Many Businesses, think of a large or small company, have many people doing many different tasks. There is a framework that had originated in economics by Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell and Daniel Rock for analyzing the work tasks for posibble automation using AI.

This framework turns out to be useful not just for economists to understand the financial or economic impact of AI, but also for businesses to identify specific opportunities to use generative AI.

Whereas there has been a lot of discussion about will AI automate jobs, it turns out that from a technical and. business perspective, it’s more useful to think of AI not as automating jobs, but as automating tasks. But it turns out that most jobs involve a collection of many tasks, for example a customer service representative will do a number of different tasks, including maybe answer inbound phone calls from customers, check status of customer orders, keep records of customer interactions, etc.

If you work in a company with many customer service representatives, the first step to analyzing the potential for using AI would be to understand for your business what are the tasks that the representatives in your company do. After that, we can take a look at these different tasks and try to asses the potential for generative AI to either hope or augment or to automate this tasks. For example answering text chats with customers may have a higher potential to be automated.

Often an analysis like this will help you decide that answering customer chat queries and keep records of customer interactions have the highest potential, and therefore focus your efforts on those two tasks.

The opportunity for generative IA could be either **augmentation** or **automation**:

- **Augmentation**: We can use generative AI to help human with a task. Eg. recommend a response for a customer service agent to edit/approve. If we are not sure yet if the generative AI will give good answers, then recommending a response could speed up the people doing the work, but not fully automate the work.
- **Automation**: Would be if we an AI system that fully automatically perform tasks. Eg. automatically transcribe and summarize record of customer interactions.

In many applications, businesses will sometime starts with **Augmentation** to may be let a human double check or finalize the output before it is used. But then as you gain trust and gain confidence in the output of the generative AI, then the user interface can be adapted to make the process more efficient for humans and the gradually shift to a higher degree of Augmentation and perhaps eventually to a fully **Automation** task.

## How do you evaluate the different tasks for generative AI potential?

The potential for Augmenting/Automating a task depends mostly on two things:

- **Technical feasibility**: refers to can AI do it? and also how costly is it to build an AI system to do it?

  A good framework to know it is to ask, can a fresh college graduate following the instructions in a prompt complete the task? If unsure, try prompting an LLM to see if you can get it to do it. This would be an experiment that you might be able to do quite quickly. Eg. If you take some prompts from answering customer chat queries and paste them into a LLM you can quickly get a sense of how go the respose is. And this could help you relative quickly asses technical feasibility of using generative AI for a particular cost.

- **Business value**: How valuable is it for AI to augment or automate a particular task? The questions I would ask to frame up my thinking of business value would be things like:

  - How much time is spent on this task? How much time savings can we actually realize?
  - Does doing this task significantly faster, cheaper or more consistently using AI create substantial value?

  While It may seem like augmentation and automation helps lead the cost savings, it may be the case that when automating a task, sometimes the benefits are much greater than just cost savings, because it also leads to rethinking the workflow around that task.

When people think of augmentation or automation, people’s mind often go initially to cost savings, because if you automate something, seems like you can save money. But in most ways of technology innovation, going back all the way to for example the invention of the steam engine, the electricity, to the computer, many companies started off thinking about cost savings but ended up putting even more of their effort into pursuing revenue growth. And that is because growth has no limit, but you can only save a defined amount of money.

When certain tasks are automated, it turns out sometimes you can rethink your workflow of how the business creates value. For example, if you could do something 1000 times cheaper because of automation eg. answering queries from costumers, then rather than just taking the cost savings, you may be able to build a new type of customer service organisation that serves people 1000 times better. And this kind of thinking can lead to growth oportunities that go well beyond cost savings.
