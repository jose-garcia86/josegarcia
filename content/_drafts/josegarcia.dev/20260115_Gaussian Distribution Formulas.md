# Gaussian Distribution Formulas

## Probability density Function

$f(x | \mu\sigma^{2}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\cdot e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}$

Where:

- $\mu$ Is the mean
- $\sigma $ Is the standard deviation
- $\sigma^{2}$ is the variance

# Binomial Distribution Formulas

## Mean

$\mu = n * p $

In other words, a fair coin has a probability of a positive outcome (heads) p = 0.5. If you flip a coin 20 times, the mean would be 20 × 0.5 = 10; you would expect to get 10 heads.

## Variance

$\sigma_{2} = n * p  * ( 1 - p) $

Continuing with the coin example, n would be the number of coin tosses and p would be the probability of getting heads.

## Standard deviation

$\sigma = \sqrt{n * p  * (1 - p)}$

or in other words, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

## Probability density function

$f(k, n, p) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \cdot p^{k}(1 - p)^{n-k}$
