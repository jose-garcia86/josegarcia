# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary

- **Class**: A blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. However, objects can be more abstract.
- **Attribute**: A descriptor or characteristic. Example would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
- **Method**: An action that a class or object could take.
- **OOP**: A commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming.
- **Encapsulation**: One of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming. You can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

In English, you might hear an attribute described as a property, description, feature, quality, trait, or characteristic. All of these are saying the same thing.
